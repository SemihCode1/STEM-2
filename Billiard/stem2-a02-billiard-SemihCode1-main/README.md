# STEM2 Tasks - Day 02 - Billiard

## TODO: Preparation (same as Day 01)

It is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the development. All code is implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you prefer, you can use TypeScript. If you use VS Code two extensions are recommended for easier development: [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). VS Code should ask you, if those extensions should be installed or not.

You can check, if the installation was successful by right-clicking the file [index.html](index.html). There should be an option "Open with LiveServer". Selecting this starts a local web server that allows the local testing of the implementation.

## TODO: Tasks

In the following, some tasks are listed that need to be implemented in order to better understand the implemented code. Note that you have to implement at least two simple, two complex and one out of context task in order to pass the assignment. Note that some tasks include observating and describing the results. The more and the better you implement the tasks, the better the grading. Please check the boxes of the tasks you implemented with x.

### Simple

(small and easy code changes)

- [x] Create many more balls and observe what happens.
- [x] Change the size and velocity of the balls and observe what happens.
- [x] Check what happens if restitution is greater than $1$.

### Complex

(needs new functions)

- [x] Change the ball color after each collision.
- [x] Make the walls more bouncy.
- [x] Add holes where the balls vanish.
- [x] Add mouse interaction to push balls.

### Out of context

(does not deal with math or physics, but can be fun)

- [x] Make each ball having a different color
- [x] Fill the canvas with a color
- [ ] Add [sounds](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/billiard/) for each [collision](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
- [ ] Add a stick (queue) to push the balls in a given or changeable direction.


## TODO: Learning protocol

**Here, you should describe how you solved the tasks from above and explain your code changes as well as the observed results. Reflect your decisions and also describe what you learned today.** (max 500 words)
