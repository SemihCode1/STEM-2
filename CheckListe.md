# STEM2 Tasks - Day 01 - Cannonball

## TODO: Preparation

It is recommended to use [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for the development. All code is implemented in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If you prefer, you can use TypeScript. If you use VS Code two extensions are recommended for easier development: [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint). VS Code should ask you, if those extensions should be installed or not.

You can check, if the installation was successful by right-clicking the file [index.html](index.html). There should be an option "Open with LiveServer". Selecting this starts a local web server that allows the local testing of the implementation.

## TODO: Tasks

In the following, some tasks are listed that need to be implemented in order to better understand the implemented code. Note that you have to implement at least two simple, one complex and one out of context task in order to pass the assignment. The more and the better you implement the tasks, the better the grading. Please check the boxes of the tasks you implemented with x.

### Simple

(small and easy code changes)

- [x] Change the size of the simulation coordinate system.
- [x] Change the size of the ball.
- [x] Make the floor less bouncy.
- [x] Change the gravity direction.

### Complex

(might need new functions)

- [x] Add another ball.
- [x] Make the balls less bouncy on both the floor and the walls.
- [x] Flip the scene so that the ball bounces on the ceiling.

### Out of context

(does not deal with math or physics, but can be fun)

- [ ] Add a cannon that fires the ball.
- [ ] Add interaction: let the cannon shoot the ball on mouse click.
- [x] Make the ball colorful.
- [x] Fill the screen with a background color.
- [ ] Add [sounds](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/cannon/) for the (invisble) cannon using the [WebAudio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).

## TODO: Learning protocol

**Here, you should describe how you solved the tasks from above and explain your code changes. Reflect your decisions and also describe what you learned today.** (max 500 words)
